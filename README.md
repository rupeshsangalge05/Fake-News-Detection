# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection is the Python based website that displays whether the news is real or fake. On the basis of checking the news is real or not from the google and other platforms is will displays the real or fake on the result page. Also, here the sign up and login is created but it is not mandatory to register to check the news.  
Here, we used web based languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript , some where used the Bootstrap framework and nows a days most trending animation library i.e. Three.js to create some better anmation at the background of each page for better look.
